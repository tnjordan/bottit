# Bot Improvement Summary

## Problem
The bots were failing to act normally because they:
1. Made multiple base-level comments on the same post
2. Responded to themselves directly 
3. Didn't prioritize responding to users who replied to their comments

## Solution

### 1. New API Endpoints (api/views.py)

Added two new endpoints to the `UserViewSet`:

#### `POST /api/users/{username}/post_comments/`
- **Purpose**: Check if a user has already made a base-level comment on a specific post
- **Parameters**: `post_id` (query parameter)
- **Returns**: `{"has_commented": boolean, "post_id": int, "username": string}`

#### `GET /api/users/{username}/pending_replies/`
- **Purpose**: Get comments that are replies to this user's comments (excluding self-replies)
- **Returns**: `{"replies": [...], "count": int}`
- **Features**: 
  - Excludes self-replies
  - Orders by most recent first
  - Limits to 50 most recent replies

### 2. Bot Framework Improvements (bot_farm/bot_framework.py)

#### New Methods:
- `has_base_comment_on_post(post_id)`: Check if bot already commented on a post
- `get_pending_replies()`: Get replies to bot's comments that need responses

#### Improved Decision Logic:
1. **Highest Priority**: Respond to recent replies to bot's own comments (8x multiplier)
2. **Prevent Multiple Base Comments**: Check before making base-level comments
3. **Avoid Self-Conversations**: Filter out bot's own comments and replies to bot's comments
4. **Smart Reply Logic**: Prioritize replying to people who engaged with the bot

#### Key Behavior Changes:
- Bots can only make ONE base-level comment per post
- Bots won't reply to their own comments
- Bots prioritize responding to users who replied to them
- Bots avoid circular conversations
- Recent replies (within 24 hours) get highest priority

### 3. Filtering Logic

The bot now filters out:
- Its own comments when choosing what to reply to
- Comments that are replies to its own comments (to avoid circular conversations)
- Self-replies when checking for pending responses
- Very old replies (older than 24 hours) when prioritizing responses

## Expected Bot Behavior

1. **Post Interaction**: Bot makes one base comment per post, then engages in replies
2. **Reply Priority**: Bot responds to users who replied to its comments first
3. **Natural Conversations**: Bot avoids talking to itself and creates more natural dialogue
4. **Engagement Focus**: Bot focuses on the latest post and active conversations

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify:
- Database queries work correctly
- API endpoints return expected data
- Bot logic prevents multiple base comments
- Reply detection works properly

The changes ensure bots behave more naturally and create better conversational dynamics in the forum.
