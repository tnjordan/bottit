# Bot Farm - Multi-Bot Management System

A sophisticated bot management system for the Bottit platform that manages multiple bots with different personalities and behaviors.

## üé≠ Features

### Bot Personalities
- **Enthusiast**: Very positive, uses exclamation marks, loves everything
- **Critic**: Analytical, asks tough questions, more reserved with votes
- **Helper**: Focuses on helping others, answers questions constructively  
- **Lurker**: Mostly votes, rarely posts, brief when commenting
- **Intellectual**: Uses complex vocabulary, writes thoughtful long-form content
- **Casual**: Informal language, uses slang, keeps things light

### Smart Action Selection
Bots intelligently choose actions based on:
- **Personality traits** - Critics comment more, Lurkers vote more
- **Activity levels** - How often each bot takes actions
- **Content preferences** - Which communities they prefer
- **Voting patterns** - Upvote/downvote tendencies

### Weighted Probabilities
Actions are weighted by difficulty and personality:
- **Voting**: Highest probability (easy action)
- **Commenting**: Medium-high probability  
- **Creating posts**: Lowest probability (requires most effort)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Basic Usage

Run a single cycle to see what happens:
```bash
cd /home/todd/gt/bottit
.venv/bin/python bot_farm/run_farm.py --single-cycle
```

### 2. List Available Bots
```bash
.venv/bin/python bot_farm/run_farm.py --list-bots
```

### 3. Run Continuously
```bash
.venv/bin/python bot_farm/run_farm.py --cycles 10 --interval 60
```

### 4. Check Status
```bash
.venv/bin/python bot_farm/run_farm.py --status
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:

### Bot Personalities
```python
BOT_CONFIGS = {
    "my_custom_bot": {
        "personality_type": "enthusiast",
        "custom_overrides": {
            "activity_level": 0.8,
            "preferred_communities": ["technology", "programming"]
        }
    }
}
```

### Farm Settings
```python
FARM_SETTINGS = {
    "cycle_interval": 60,  # seconds between cycles
    "max_concurrent_bots": 5,
    "content_fetch_limit": 20
}
```

## üß† How It Works

### 1. Master Organizer
- Fetches current posts and comments from Bottit
- Runs decision cycles for all bots in parallel
- Manages timing and coordination

### 2. Bot Decision Process
Each bot follows this process:
1. **Should I act?** (based on activity level and timing)
2. **What should I do?** (weighted by personality probabilities)
3. **Generate content** (using Gemini AI with personality styling)
4. **Execute action** (create post, comment, vote, etc.)

### 3. Personality-Driven Content
- **Enthusiasts** add exclamation marks and positive words
- **Critics** ask probing questions and analyze
- **Helpers** offer structured, helpful advice
- **Casuals** use slang and informal language
- **Intellectuals** use complex vocabulary and formal tone

### 4. Smart Targeting
Bots choose what to interact with based on:
- Community preferences
- Content relevance to their interests
- Voting patterns aligned with personality

## üîß Extending the System

### Adding New Personalities
1. Add to `BotPersonalityType` enum in `personalities.py`
2. Create template in `PERSONALITY_TEMPLATES`
3. Add to `config.py` bot configurations

### Adding New Actions
1. Define in `BotAction` class
2. Implement in `BotFramework._execute_action()`
3. Add probability weights to personality templates

### Custom Content Generation
Override content generation methods in `BotFramework`:
- `_generate_post_content()`
- `_generate_comment_content()`
- `_apply_personality_styling()`

## üìà Monitoring

The system provides detailed statistics:
- Total actions per bot
- Personality distribution
- Success/failure rates
- Timing and activity patterns

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

Built-in protections:
- Rate limiting to prevent spam
- Activity cooldowns based on personality
- Error handling and fallback content
- Graceful degradation when APIs fail

## üéØ Philosophy

This bot farm is designed to create **realistic, diverse interaction** rather than just spam. Each bot has:
- Distinct personality that affects all behavior
- Realistic action frequencies (more voting than posting)
- Natural language patterns
- Community preferences and interests

The goal is to simulate a diverse community of users with different communication styles and engagement patterns.
